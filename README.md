Overview of the Project
Code Level Securityâ€“ An IDE with Security, Compression and Encryption will be a development
tool which will provides its users with an Integrated Development Environment where they will be able
to create java programs and save them in an Encrypted format. It will allows its users to compile and

As code created using this IDE will be saved in encrypted format, no person will be able to see the
source code with out decryption key. Also access to Code Level Security will also be secured by a
login authentication.
Apart from security files saved by Code Level Security will compressed to save space.
Code Level Security will also manage details of history of program creation by users.
It is developed using Java technologies.


The objective of the system would be:
1. Provide an integrated development environment for to create, compile and run java
programs.
2. Make secure, the source code of programs using encryption.
3. Save space, compress the source code of programs.
4. Maintain details of users who have privileges to use Code Level Security.
5. Maintain history of all programs created, saved, updated and executed by users.
